# Numix-Bluish-GIT
Numix-Bluish Gnome theme to be updated for 3.16

Changelog

-------------
Initial upload of files to GitHub for editing. The uploaded files
currently look great on 3.14, not so much on 3.16. Anyone who
feels like helping, by all means, clone, edit, and push :)

Numix-Original folder contains an original version of Numix-theme
updated for 3.16

Numix-Bluish-3.14 folder contains the old files for Numix-Bluish 3.14
figure the easiest way will be to switch the color values in
Numix-Original with the ones from Numix-Bluish

I'm also thinking that at some point, I'll update the window controls
to be round like those in Evo-Pop, but one step at a time I guess.
