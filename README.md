========
About
========

The uploaded files
currently look great on 3.14, not so much on 3.16. Anyone who
feels like helping, by all means, clone, edit, and push :)


Numix-Bluish-3.16 folder contains an original version of Numix-theme
updated for 3.16, we'll just change the color codes in this theme
to reflect those in Numix-Bluish-3.14. Also plan on chaning the window controls
to ones more like Evo-Pop's or Yosembiance (round)

Numix-Bluish-3.14 folder contains the old files for Numix-Bluish 3.14
